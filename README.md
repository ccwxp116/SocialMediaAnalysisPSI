# Social Media Analysis for Partnership for Strategic Impact (PSI)

This repository is a collaborative effort by **Shiqi Wang**, **Huixin Yang**, and **Ningxin Zhang**, aimed at extracting insights from major social networks for [**Partnership for Strategic Impact (PSI)**](https://impactstorycoaching.com/meet-your-coaches/). The project leverages **natural language processing (NLP)** and **machine learning models** to identify key determinants of social media engagement, including likes and comments.

For further information, view the [**Technical Report**](SocialMediaAnalysisPSI/reports/Technical%20Report.pdf).

## Overview

This project provides an end-to-end solution for collecting, processing, and analyzing social media data to identify significant determinants of social media engagement. It includes:
- Applying **NLP techniques** such as tokenization and lemmatization to convert raw text into analyzable data.
- Using **machine learning models** to correlate social media text and metadata with engagement metrics (e.g., likes, comments).

## Features

- **Automated Data Scraping**:
  - Collect structured and unstructured data from major social media platforms.
  - Extract metadata including post text, likes, and comments.

- **Text Preprocessing**:
  - Tokenize and lemmatize text for NLP analysis.
  - Transform social media text into structured data for machine learning.

- **Machine Learning Models**:
  - Train models to uncover patterns influencing social media engagement, including:
    - **Linear Regression**
    - **Decision Tree**
    - **Random Forest**
