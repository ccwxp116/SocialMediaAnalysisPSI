Instead, you can decide to dedicate X hours this week/month/year to your evaluation or org development work, and then we can work with you to allocate/prioritize those hours in real-time.

 Many of the nonprofit and coalition leaders I work with feel like they meet themselves coming and going. You can‚Äôt make the time to make evaluation and data collection a priority because you are so darn busy.One day, you tell yourself, you will have the time to organize your data and make evaluation a priority. You will finally be able to make informed decisions rather than operate in crisis mode. You have people to take care of after all!It‚Äôs not wrong to prioritize service over #‚Äôs. You choose your work because you wanted to help people!Wouldn‚Äôt it be great to have all the powerful evidence you need at your fingertips to satisfy your funders, provide feedback to your key stakeholders, and be accountable to your community members? Imagine no longer having to spend hours digging for the information you need for the funder report or last-minute information request. So stressful!I don‚Äôt know about you but I HATE to spend time looking for things. Take my email in-box. I admit it, it‚Äôs a mess. Sixty thousand emails because I never delete anything. I so need to Marie Kondo my in-box. I am DETERMINED to do it and get everything in the right folder so I can find important information quickly and not be distracted by the unimportant stuff or junk!Imagine if you had the information you need at your finger-tips, no more stress, no more frantic searches. You can have a system that fits within your busy day and makes your life easier. Here‚Äôs a secret, most nonprofits and coalitions don‚Äôt need a fancy, expensive data system or CRM. Here are three simple tips for you:1.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†Good old Excel will take you a long way. No fancy, expensive software needed.2.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†Pick the most important ‚Äúprocess data‚Äù (AKA things you can count) to measure. You know, the things you are asked to report on most often (Number served, who you serve, level of services etc.).3.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†Pick a few outcomes (changes in attitudes, knowledge, behaviors, or policy changes) that get to the heart of the change you are working to achieve.Reality check: Your evaluation process doesn‚Äôt have to be perfect! You just need to get started. Is my in-box totally organized? Nope not yet. But every day, I tackle it a little bit. Let this be the day you move towards being able to know that you are making a difference. Take the baby steps that move you and your organization towards the peace and clarity that comes from knowing exactly how to show you are making a difference.#leaders #nonprofit #community #coalition #data

 On this week's Community Possibilities podcast, Community Builder Danyetta Najoli offers these tips:1) Connect others on common interests. No one wants to be labeled by a negative.2) Create strong neighborhoods through bringing people into the lives of others.3) We all want to be named and known!4) There are ""treasures"" withing our neighborhood and communities. Find your local treasures.5) Attract others through hospitality or other ways that speak to them. Not every approach works for all people. 6) Ever heard of a ""Human Library?"" Me either!7) Use an asset-based community model  and an approach the values roles not disabilities.

 Come join the growing list of Equity in Action alumni aligning their workplace processes with a health-equity lens. Equity in Action workshops focus on how public health professionals can better foster, develop, and practice diversity and cultural capacity through awareness, knowledge, and skills.¬†The field of evaluation is being challenged to utilize processes that consider who is being evaluated and who is conducting the evaluation. MPHI has developed a framework for strategic engagement in service of a culturally responsive, racially equitable evaluation (CRREE).¬†Using this framework can transform evaluations. Critical and substantive nuances are often missed, ignored, or misinterpreted when an evaluator is unaware of the culture of those being evaluated. CRREE can be utilized to undo racism and oppression previously upheld by researchers, evaluators, institutions, and systems.¬†Utilizing Culturally Responsive and Racially Equitable EvaluationOctober 4-6, 2022 from 1:00-5:00pm ETVirtual - ZoomCost: $495¬†All attendees will receive a certificate of attendance with educational hours.¬†Thank you, and we look forward to seeing you in October!

 Happy Spring!  It is the time of new beginnings and I am starting to see the seeds sewn sprout.  One of our big goals at Mirror Group LLC this year is to document, streamline, and automate all of our core business processes. Ambitious, yes. So why do this? Because we intend to get out of cycles of #work, Work, WORK, overwork, #rest, work, Work, WORK, overwork, #BURNOUT .... and the cycle repeats. We seek to set the conditions to thrive where we can continue to bring our whole selves to our work without that being an unnecessary sacrifice.  Why is that important?Because doing the work at the intersection of data + equity is heavy, weighty work. And it is work that we love. And it is work that supports the communities that we love.How to hold it all in community and interdependent work is what is on my mind these days.
