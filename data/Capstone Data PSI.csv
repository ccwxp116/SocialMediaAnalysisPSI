One way to balance your introvert and extrovert sides is to identify self care activities that meet the needs of both sides separately and together.

Grab a sheet of paper, something to write with, and create your introvert/extrovert self care plan. Swipe through for ideas: 

SECOND PIC: Think of a Venn diagram, where two circles overlap in the middle. Draw out your circles and label the left side as INTROVERT and the right as EXTROVERT. In each circle, list self care activities and/or people you can count on that speak to either side. What would an introverted or extroverted self care activity look like during the pandemic?

THIRD PIC: Now, list the overlap section as BOTH. In this section, list activities that you could do by yourself but can be shared with another person. This helps you create a self care plan that is well-rounded. Here's one example.
