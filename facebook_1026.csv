JoanGarryConsulting,"Board bashing is pretty much an Olympic sport in the nonprofit sector these days. EDs are always complaining about board members who are asleep at the switch, micromanaging, or abusing their power. Some even complain that their boards have zero connection to the work.

Here’s my hypothesis: Most nonprofit leaders don’t actually know what a high-functioning board of directors even looks like.

Tune in to learn what I see as a high-functioning nonprofit board that will truly help your org thrive.
